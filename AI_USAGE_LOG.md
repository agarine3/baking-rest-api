# AI Usage Log

This document tracks the use of AI tools during the development of the Banking REST API.

## Tools Used

- **Cursor AI**: Primary development assistant for code generation and project setup
- **Claude**: Code review and architectural decisions

## Development Sessions

### Session 1: Initial Project Setup (Current)
- **Date**: [Current Date]
- **Duration**: ~30 minutes
- **Tools Used**: Cursor AI
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Created complete project scaffold with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite
  - Set up directory structure for all components
  - Configured JWT authentication setup
  - Created basic configuration files
  - Set up Alembic for database migrations
  - Created initial test structure
  - Added comprehensive requirements.txt

- **AI Prompts Used**:
  - "Generate a directory and file scaffold for a banking REST API using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (SQLite), and JWT authentication"
  - Various follow-up prompts for specific file creation

- **Challenges Faced**:
  - None significant - straightforward setup

- **Manual Intervention Required**:
  - None - AI handled all setup tasks effectively

## Key Learnings

- AI tools excel at project scaffolding and boilerplate code generation
