  - Created comprehensive test suite for models
  - Fixed SQLAlchemy relationship issues with foreign keys

- **AI Prompts Used**:
  - "Write SQLAlchemy models (Python 3.11+) for AccountHolder, Account, Transaction, Card, and Statement entities for a banking application. Represent relationships and basic fields for each model."
  - Various prompts for fixing relationship issues and testing

- **Challenges Faced**:
  - SQLAlchemy ambiguous foreign key relationships in Transaction model
  - Model instantiation issues in tests due to relationship conflicts

- **Manual Intervention Required**:
  - Fixed foreign key relationship specification in Account model

### Session 3: Pydantic Schemas and Authentication System
- **Date**: [Current Date]
- **Duration**: ~15 minutes
- **Tools Used**: Claude, Cursor IDE
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Created comprehensive Pydantic schemas for all API endpoints
  - Implemented JWT authentication system with password hashing
  - Built user signup and login endpoints
  - Created account management endpoints (create, list, retrieve)
  - Added proper request/response validation
  - Implemented secure password storage with bcrypt
  - Created authentication middleware and dependencies
  - Added comprehensive error handling and validation

- **AI Prompts Used**:
  - "Create Pydantic models for the signup, authentication, account creation, transaction, money transfer, card issuance, and statement retrieval endpoints"
  - "Write FastAPI endpoints for user signup and login with secure password storing (bcrypt/passlib). Return JWT token upon successful login."
  - "Write FastAPI endpoints to: (1) list all account holders, (2) retrieve their info, (3) create bank accounts, (4) fetch account details. Secure endpoints with JWT authentication."

- **Challenges Faced**:
  - Missing email-validator dependency for EmailStr fields
  - JWT token generation and validation implementation
  - Proper authentication flow and error handling

- **Manual Intervention Required**:
  - **Package Installation**: Manually installed `email-validator` package to resolve Pydantic EmailStr validation errors
  - **Dependency Management**: Added missing dependencies to requirements.txt and installed them
  - **Testing and Validation**: Performed comprehensive manual testing of all endpoints:
    - Tested user signup with valid data
    - Verified password hashing and storage
    - Tested login endpoint and JWT token generation
    - Validated account creation with authentication
    - Tested protected endpoint access with and without tokens
    - Verified proper error responses for unauthorized access
  - **Server Management**: Started and managed uvicorn development server
  - **API Testing**: Used curl commands to test all endpoints manually
  - **Error Resolution**: Fixed import errors and dependency issues as they arose
  - **Database Verification**: Confirmed database operations and data persistence
  - **Security Testing**: Verified JWT token validation and authentication flow

### Session 4: Testing and Validation
- **Date**: [Current Date]
- **Duration**: ~10 minutes
- **Tools Used**: Claude, Cursor IDE
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Comprehensive testing of all implemented endpoints
  - Validation of authentication system
  - Database operation verification
  - Security testing and validation
  - Performance testing of API responses

- **AI Prompts Used**:
  - Testing and validation requests
  - Error resolution prompts

- **Challenges Faced**:
  - Ensuring all endpoints work correctly
  - Validating security measures
  - Confirming data persistence

- **Manual Intervention Required**:
  - **Comprehensive Testing**: Manually tested all endpoints with curl commands
  - **Authentication Flow**: Verified complete signup → login → protected access flow
  - **Data Validation**: Confirmed proper data storage and retrieval
  - **Error Handling**: Tested various error scenarios and edge cases
  - **Security Validation**: Verified JWT token expiration and validation
  - **Performance Monitoring**: Monitored server logs and response times
  - **Documentation Verification**: Confirmed API documentation generation

## Key Learnings

- AI tools excel at project scaffolding and boilerplate code generation
- Clear, specific prompts yield better results
- AI can handle complex configuration files effectively
- SQLAlchemy relationships need explicit foreign key specification when multiple FKs exist
- Testing database models requires careful approach to avoid relationship conflicts
- Multiple AI tools can be leveraged for different aspects of development
- **Manual testing is crucial for validating AI-generated code**
- **Dependency management often requires manual intervention**
- **Security implementations need thorough manual validation**
- **Real-world testing reveals issues not apparent in code review**

## Time Management

- **Total Time Allocated**: 1 hour
- **Time Used So Far**: ~40 minutes
- **Remaining Time**: ~20 minutes
- **Next Priority**: Complete remaining endpoints (transactions, cards, statements)

## Manual Interventions Summary

### Common Manual Fixes Applied:
1. **Dependency Resolution**: Installed missing packages (email-validator, etc.)
2. **Server Management**: Started/stopped development server as needed
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive manual testing of all endpoints
4. **Error Debugging**: Resolved import errors and configuration issues
5. **Security Validation**: Verified authentication and authorization flows
6. **Data Verification**: Confirmed database operations and data persistence
7. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitored server logs and response times
