# AI Usage Log

This document tracks the use of AI tools during the development of the Banking REST API.

## Tools Used

- **Cursor IDE**: Primary development environment with AI assistance
- **Claude**: Code generation, architectural decisions, and problem-solving
- **ChatGPT**: Alternative AI assistance for coding tasks
- **Various AI Tools**: Leveraging multiple AI assistants for rapid development

## Development Sessions

### Session 1: Initial Project Setup
- **Date**: [Current Date]
- **Duration**: ~5 minutes
- **Tools Used**: Claude, Cursor IDE
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Created complete project scaffold with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite
  - Set up directory structure for all components
  - Configured JWT authentication setup
  - Created basic configuration files
  - Set up Alembic for database migrations
  - Created initial test structure
  - Added comprehensive requirements.txt

- **AI Prompts Used**:
  - "Generate a directory and file scaffold for a banking REST API using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (SQLite), and JWT authentication"
  - Various follow-up prompts for specific file creation

- **Challenges Faced**:
  - None significant - straightforward setup

- **Manual Intervention Required**:
  - None - AI handled all setup tasks effectively

### Session 2: Database Models Implementation
- **Date**: [Current Date]
- **Duration**: ~10 minutes
- **Tools Used**: Claude, Cursor IDE
- **Tasks Completed**:
  - Created comprehensive SQLAlchemy models for banking entities
  - Implemented User, Account, Transaction, Card, and Statement models
  - Added proper relationships and foreign key constraints
  - Created enum classes for account types, transaction types, card types, etc.
  - Set up Alembic migration for database schema
  - Created comprehensive test suite for models
  - Fixed SQLAlchemy relationship issues with foreign keys

- **AI Prompts Used**:
  - "Write SQLAlchemy models (Python 3.11+) for AccountHolder, Account, Transaction, Card, and Statement entities for a banking application. Represent relationships and basic fields for each model."
  - Various prompts for fixing relationship issues and testing

- **Challenges Faced**:
  - SQLAlchemy ambiguous foreign key relationships in Transaction model
  - Model instantiation issues in tests due to relationship conflicts

- **Manual Intervention Required**:
  - Fixed foreign key relationship specification in Account model
  - Created simpler test approach to avoid model instantiation issues
  - Updated Alembic configuration for proper migration generation

## Key Learnings

- AI tools excel at project scaffolding and boilerplate code generation
- Clear, specific prompts yield better results
- AI can handle complex configuration files effectively
- SQLAlchemy relationships need explicit foreign key specification when multiple FKs exist
- Testing database models requires careful approach to avoid relationship conflicts
- Multiple AI tools can be leveraged for different aspects of development

## Time Management

- **Total Time Allocated**: 1 hour
- **Time Used So Far**: ~15 minutes
- **Remaining Time**: ~45 minutes
- **Next Priority**: Authentication system and API endpoints

## Next Steps

- Implement authentication system (signup, login, JWT tokens)
- Create API endpoints for core banking functions
- Add security middleware and validation
- Build comprehensive API documentation
